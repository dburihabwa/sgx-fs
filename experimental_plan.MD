## Experimental plan

Measurement of SGX file system's performance variations in different configurations (loopback vs all-in-enclave vs all-in memory vs on disk) running semi-realistic filebench workloads.


* Relative performance
* Energy consumption
* Memory overhead

### Relative performance

A comparison of the overhead introduced by different versions of a FUSE file system using intel SGX for encryption purposes.

### Energy consumption

Tracking down which feature introduces the biggest changes in energy consumption.

### Memory overhead

Check if the performance impact track with the known memory limits of SGX enclaves.
